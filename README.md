Scripts developed while working through the Packt book Hands-On AWS Penetration Testing with Kali Linux

Storing some of the info here as well because it makes the code easier to decipher. I hope this will be a useful resource for people reading the book.

### Notes
My notes from working through the book are available at https://apageinsec.wordpress.com/hands-on-aws-penetration-testing-with-kali-linux-notes/
